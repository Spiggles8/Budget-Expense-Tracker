# Financial-Tracker
This project utilizes Bootstrap for the website design and Javascript for the program implementation.

This is just a simple budget and expense tracker. 
You enter in your budget for various categories and then enter in a list of expenses with the budget category specified and it calculates how much budget you have left and your total number and cash amount spent.

The next phase of this project will be to implement it to mySql most likely using React as this will be a stepping stone to begin a portfolio project.
