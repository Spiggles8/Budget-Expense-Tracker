# Finances-Tracker

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, BootStrap, JavaScript

This website gives the user the ability to manage finances including budget, incomes, and expenses. 
The user enters data through forms and that gets added to tables in each tab. 
This data then all gets compiled in to the Monthly Overview Table. 
The user is able to add and delete items in the tables.

Future Updates/Considerations: 
1. Create full stack app using ReactJs and NodeJS to allow individual users to login and save info.
2. Ultimately, I want the option when registering to be for either a family or business and adjust options accordingly.
3. Need to be able to collaborate data with other users. 
4. Need to make fully responsive.
